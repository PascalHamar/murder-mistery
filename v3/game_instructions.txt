Gameplay:

The Murder Mystery Game is about a group of players who work together to solve a murder that has previously taken place.
One of the players is the murderer and does not want to be caught.
The game begins with the discovery of the victim.
The prequel deals with the discovery of the victim and ends with the characters of the story gathering in a room after one of the characters has found the body.
Each character knows what they did in the hours before (with approximate times). Each player has a timeline. The hours in the timeline are the number of rounds.
Each round is discussed together for one hour and the players discuss what they did during the hour and what they observed.
After the discussion about the last hour before the crime, each player makes a guess about the murderer, then the crime is solved and the murderer is announced.
